Base Model
This project employs the ECAPA-TDNN model, an open-source architecture for speaker and sound event representation.
Repository: SpeechBrain
License: Apache 2.0
The model was originally developed for robust speaker verification and has been widely adapted in speech and sound event recognition tasks.
Adaptation for USSD
To fit the Urban Salient Sound Dataset (USSD), we performed fine-tuning and multi-feature training on the ECAPA-TDNN backbone:
Fine-tuning:
The pre-trained SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN model was fine-tuned on USSD to capture salient sound events in urban acoustic environments.
Multi-feature training:
We integrated three acoustic features to enhance model robustness against complex noise:
Spectrogram (linear frequency scale, capturing full spectral energy distribution)
Mel-spectrogram (perceptually motivated frequency scaling, emphasizing human hearing sensitivity)
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) (compact representation of spectral envelope, widely used in speech/audio recognition)
These features were jointly used as input representations, allowing the model to learn complementary information across different acoustic domains.
Training strategy:
Optimizer: Adam with learning rate warmup
Data augmentation: Mixup and SpecAugment
Evaluation metrics: classification accuracy on both fine-grained (22 classes) and coarse (5 categories) sound events
Benchmark Results on USSD
Accuracy (22 classes): 91.3%
Accuracy (5 categories): 93.9%
Best-performing class: Mechanical sounds (99.1%)
Most common errors: confusions within traffic vs. mechanical sounds
These results confirm that the adapted ECAPA-TDNN, trained with multiple acoustic features, effectively detects salient sound events in diverse urban contexts.
